census data into a sqlite database limited to LA County, then extract
that data and analyze trends in the demographics of LA starting from 2000
data.  The particular interest is for Westchester / Playa neighborhoods.

## Features

* Create the database schema - based on the fields available in the legacy format
* Insert census data into the database for all blocks in LA County (037)
